Rahul:
Good morning everyone, we need to finalize UAT process before next client review. 
Client expects to see clear acceptance criteria + test scenarios linked to features. 
Can we demo flashcard & quiz gen?

Priya:
Yes, but we need mock content ready for that. Should we use internal blogs/docs for UAT?

Arjun:
Agreed. Let’s define 4–5 workflows: upload → index → query → summarize → generate quiz.

Sneha:
We can auto-log all user actions during UAT for feedback. I’ll set up basic tracking.

Rahul:
Perfect. I’ll create UAT checklist + doc for client walk-through. Target: by Wed.
Also prepare a fallback plan if embedding or AI search gives bad results. Just in case.

Priya:
Got it. Will include both good and noisy data in the test set.

Arjun:
Let’s dry run UAT internally on Tuesday.
