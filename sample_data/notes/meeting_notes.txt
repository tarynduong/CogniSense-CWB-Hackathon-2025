Teams Mtg Notes â€“ Brainstorm: Data Pipeline Optimization
Date: 25 Apr 2025
Attendees: Rahul (PM), Priya (DE), Arjun (Architect), Sneha (MLOps), Kiran (Azure SME)

1) Goal
Improve data pipeline reliability, reduce manual fixes, auto-monitoring, align on best practices.

2) Key discussion points
Priya:
+. Schema breaks from upstream â€” no alerts â†’ manual fix every time.
+. Need auto schema val + fallback defaults.
+. Wants reusable transform blocks (modular ETL).

Arjun:
+. Same logic copied across 3+ pipelines â†’ hard to update.
+. Push for shared lib w/ versioning (Git + CI).
+. Lineage unclear â€” use Purview or similar.

Sneha:
+. No DQ (data quality) checks â†’ silent failures in prod.
+. Discuss pre-prod step.
+. Need alerting on drift/anomalies â†’ prefer Logic Apps over manual logs.

Kiran:
+. ADF good for scale, but static config blocks flexibility.
+. Try param pipelines + trigger-based runs.
+. Suggest connecting ADF to Azure Monitor for metrics/logs.

Rahul:
+. Teams often misaligned on schema versions â†’ propose data contracts per stream.
+. Add KPIs to measure pipeline health (fail %, retries, alert time).

3) Action items
- Priya to build modular ADF pipeline (1 source â†’ 2 sinks) using reusable dataflows.
- Arjun to draft versioning plan for ETL logic + schema registry approach (Purview).
- Sneha do POC Great Expectations in one pipeline â†’ log results.
- Kiran to enable Azure Monitor for 2 test pipelines + set alerts on failure.
- Rahul to define initial KPIs for pipeline ops (uptime, error rate, manual touches).

ðŸ“… Next Steps
- Review progress in 2 weeks (demo + bottleneck report)
- Collect feedback on DQ/alerts
- Start rollout plan for top 3 priority DPs in May
