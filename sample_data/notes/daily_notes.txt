Morning:
Reviewed UI flow for content upload. Some friction with blog URL input → flagged to frontend team.
Followed up with Arjun on UAT flow mapping → diagrams pending.
Checked AI Search response quality for tool docs — relevant but too verbose, might need summarization tweak.

Afternoon:
Worked on UAT checklist. Focused on: ingestion success, vector search match, summary accuracy, quiz quality.
Had sync with Anika re: client demo expectations. Flashcard demo is key.
Wrote draft email for client walk-through — sent to Sneha for review.

Blockers:
No updated mock content from Priya yet → can’t finalize demo examples.
Not sure if log tracking is working properly (Sneha to confirm).

Next Steps:
Finalize UAT doc
Get confirmation on tracking logs
Prep talking points for demo
